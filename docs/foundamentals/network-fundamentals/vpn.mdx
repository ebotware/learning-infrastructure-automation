# VPN & network security basics

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** creates a **secure, encrypted tunnel** between your device and the internet.

**In simple terms:**
It hides your IP address and protects your data from being seen or stolen.

### What a VPN does:

* **Encrypts your data** (scrambles it so others can’t read it)
* **Hides your real location/IP**
* **Protects you on public Wi-Fi**
* Lets you **access region-restricted content**

## How a VPN Works (Quick Flow)

1. You connect to a VPN app
2. Your data is encrypted on your device
3. Data travels through the VPN server
4. The internet sees the VPN’s IP, not yours


## Types of VPNs

* **Remote Access VPN** – For individuals (work from home, personal privacy)
* **Site-to-Site VPN** – Connects entire networks (company branches)
* **Client-based VPN** – Requires software (most common)
* **Browser-based VPN** – Limited, less secure

## Network Security Basics

Network security protects data, devices, and systems from attacks.

### Core Concepts:

* **Confidentiality** – Only authorized users see the data
* **Integrity** – Data isn’t altered
* **Availability** – Systems stay accessible (CIA Triad)

## Common Network Security Tools

* **Firewalls** – Filter traffic in/out of a network
* **Antivirus / Anti-malware** – Detect and remove threats
* **IDS / IPS** – Detect & prevent intrusions
* **VPNs** – Secure data in transit
* **Encryption** – Protect stored and transmitted data

## Common Network Threats

* Phishing attacks
* Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
* Malware & ransomware
* DDoS attacks
* Weak passwords

## Best Practices

* Use **strong, unique passwords**
* Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
* Keep systems **updated**
* Avoid unknown public Wi-Fi (or use a VPN)
* Encrypt sensitive data
